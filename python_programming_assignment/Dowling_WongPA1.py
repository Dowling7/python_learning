# Programming Assignment #1 #
# Description: Hi, dear TA. I'm happy to leave a message for you in front of my code.
# I have eliminated the redundancy in similar lines, which I believe will make the code more organized and readable. So my code might be a liitle different from other's
# Hope you will not blame me for this little insistence.
# Also, by deviding the function into different parts, the code is already very readable and clear, so I haven't add any note amoung lines.
# Thank you!
